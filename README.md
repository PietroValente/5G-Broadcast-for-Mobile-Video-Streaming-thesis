## Abstract

The rapid evolution of communication technologies has brought forth a dynamic landscape for digital media platforms. Smartphones, tablets, Virtual Reality (VR) devices, and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses have seamlessly integrated with TVs, creating a multimedia communication paradigm. In this context, media companies are turning to 5G technology for revolutionary content delivery possibilities.

This thesis aligns with the ministerial project *"Rai Way Experimentation of 5G Broadcast Network and Services in the 700 MHz Band in the Cities of Turin and Palermo"*, a collaborative effort led by RaiWay and involves key partners such as RAI Research, Politecnico di Milano, Rohde&Schwarz, MainStreaming, Impersive, and Kineton. Its objectives include implementing 5G Broadcast according to 3GPP Rel.14, showcasing tailored utilization scenarios, integrating advanced technologies like Content Delivery Network (CDN) and VR360Â° production, and testing the technology using granted transmitters in Turin and Palermo.

The thesis dives into the integration of 5G Broadcast and CDN technologies, emphasizing the development of a Seamless Switching Application (SSA) to ensure uninterrupted service delivery. It explores practical tests, with a particular emphasis on the automotive use case, in pursuit of fine-tuning SSA parameters and enhancing its effectiveness.

The research findings contribute to the evolving landscape of media delivery, with a focus on live event transmission, enabling seamless, high-quality content distribution to a growing audience, with applications extending beyond entertainment.
